                    The Golden Temple, also known as Harmandir Sahib, meaning "abode of God" or DarbƒÅr Sahib, meaning "exalted court" is a Gurdwara located in the city of Amritsar, Punjab, India. It is the preeminent spiritual site of Sikhism.The Gurdwara is built around
                    a man-made pool (sarovar) that was completed by the fourth Sikh Guru, Guru Ram Das in 1577.Guru Arjan,the fifth Guru of Sikhism, requested Sai Mir Mian Mohammed, a Muslim Pir of Lahore, to lay its foundation stone in 1589. In 1604,
                    Guru Arjan placed a copy of the Adi Granth in Harmandir Sahib. The Gurdwara was repeatedly rebuilt by the Sikhs after it became a target of persecution and was destroyed several times by the Mughal and invading Afghan armies. Maharaja
                    Ranjit Singh after founding the Sikh Empire, rebuilt it in marble and copper in 1809, overlaid the sanctum with gold foil in 1830. This has led to the name the Golden Temple.The Golden Temple is spiritually the most significant shrine
                    in sikhism. It became a center of the Singh Sabha Movement between 1883 and 1920s,and the Punjabi Suba movement between 1947 and 1966. In the early 1980s, the Gurdwara became a center of conflict between the Indian government led by
                    Indira Gandhi, some Sikh groups and a faithful movement led by Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale seeking to create a new nation named Khalistan.
